Normally, area chart + overlapping metrics + 3D space is the perfect recipe for a disaster. Except, it isn't in this visual. This interactive visual delivers the message clearly without any interaction. Neat colors, meaningful interactive options and positioning in (surprise!) 3D space makes this visual great.
